Yet his courage and lightning attack has caused the lordly eagle to veer from his flight; 00:20 No bird on earth can match the dashing flight, flashing plumage and gallant wooing of this gorgeous sprite of the airways; 00:30 In the scenes which follow, many of them never before photographed, you will see the full life cycle of the Broadtailed Hummer. He is common throughout the west and deceptively similar to the eastern Ruby-throat; 00:38 Finding a nest; 00:59 The male: A restless, carefree fellow who takes no part in the nest building, incubation or rearing of the young. His throat, typical of most male hummers, changes from soft black to flashing red; 01:32 Note the needle-like tongue; 02:14 The female: Iridescent throat speckles vary from practically none to a conspicuous spot; 03:04 Building the nest: The nest, about the size of a walnut, is built of cotton-like material stuccoed with flakes of bark. Spider webs are used to bind the materials together and anchor the nest to the twig; 03:54 Each nest contains two eggs about the size of many beans. Incubation requires about 15 days; 05:16 Five days old: The young are fed a mixture of partly digested insects and nectar; 06:04 The body is full grown at 15 days; 07:00 Twenty days old: At 20 days the nest is battered down by their active preparation for flight. The cautious young Hummers never fall as they leave the nest; 08:27 they can fly at 20 days but usually 5 days more are spent on the nest, fanning and testing their wings to assure a successful first flight; 08:54 Number 1 takes off.","Title on case: The Hummingbird","1 film reel (16 mm) color; silent; acetate film; 400 feet","Runtime: 10:43","[1940/1941]","","MovingImage","http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/MovingImage","motion pictures (visual works)","http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300136900","color film (film, material)","http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300127339","video/mp4","https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/video/mp4","","","","","","","Hummingbirds","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/963726","","","","","","","","","Hummingbirds--Behavior","http://id.worldcat.org/fast/963727","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:/47540/3t4n6841s48g","U183071337551_narv_cockerell_hummingbird_a.mp4","English","http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng","University of Colorado Boulder Libraries, Special Collections & Archives Finding Aid","https://archives.colorado.edu/repositories/2/archival_objects/268313","Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell Papers; COU:359; Item Barcode: U183071337551","","The copyright and related rights status of this Item has been reviewed by the organization that has made the Item available, but the organization was unable to make a conclusive determination as to the copyright status of the Item.
